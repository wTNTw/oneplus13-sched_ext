	  This option enables a new scheduler class sched_ext (SCX), which
	  allows scheduling policies to be implemented as BPF programs to
	  achieve the following:

	  - Ease of experimentation and exploration: Enabling rapid
	    iteration of new scheduling policies.
	  - Customization: Building application-specific schedulers which
	    implement policies that are not applicable to general-purpose
	    schedulers.
	  - Rapid scheduler deployments: Non-disruptive swap outs of
	    scheduling policies in production environments.

	  sched_ext leverages BPFâ€™s struct_ops feature to define a structure
	  which exports function callbacks and flags to BPF programs that
	  wish to implement scheduling policies. The struct_ops structure
	  exported by sched_ext is struct sched_ext_ops, and is conceptually
	  similar to struct sched_class.
